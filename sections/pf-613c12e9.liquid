Then, in 2019, during the Paris Fashion Week, we discovered that few people really take care of their feet and legs. So, starting from the feet, we took several steps forward. We decided to walk barefoot by taking off our shoes and everything else with our brand. Then, we opened our new base in London and focused on the essence of body and soul through unconventional perfumes and skincare.<br><br>We don’t reject anything from our past; we love the journey that brought us here. All the people we have met have left us something we have used and blended together. Assembled Around Aesthetics, this is our creative guiding spirit.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-parallax="true" data-parallax-speed="4" data-section-id="pf-4102" data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-eFegNN kRTGhu pf-17_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0760/5184/1309/files/STORE-PH-OKAAADESCR-092023.jpg?v=1695499965" class="sc-fXEqDS fvolg pf-parallax-img" alt="parallax" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="800" style="opacity:0"/><div style="--cw:1430px" class="sc-jWUzzU jXgGHC"><div class="sc-kfPuZi ihOOoE pf-18_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-jHkVzv dZEEUA pf-19_"><h3 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-20_ pf-gs-heading-1">What does it mean to be unconventional?

It has nothing to do with all of that, especially not with a self-centered approach to living, among others.<br><br>But instead, try always to be yourself. Have your own beliefs and continuously pursue them. It means believing in values and dreams, pursuing healthy goals, having your thoughts without being influenced by common thinking, and being unconventional, which means having respect for oneself and, at the same time, for others. It means believing that beauty starts from within us. So, if all around us is just appearance, think that your true beauty comprises 70% inner beauty and 30% care of your outer beauty. <br><br>And we don't hide it, but we would like to be part of 30% of your outer beauty.
